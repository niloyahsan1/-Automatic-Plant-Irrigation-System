# Automatic Plant Irrigation System
## A Project of CSE260 course of BRACU

- Our proposal focuses on automatic irrigation, offering significant benefits for efficient watering, especially during periods of human absence such as vacations. By employing an automatic irrigation control system, we aim to eliminate human intervention while optimizing water usage. This involves monitoring soil moisture levels continuously to determine irrigation needs and employing a pumping device to deliver the necessary water to the soil.
